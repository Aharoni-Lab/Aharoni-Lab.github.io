title: "Open lab positions"
---

The Aharoni Lab currently has multiple open positions for postdocs and graduate student researchers. These are all multi-year NIH funded positions at the interface of neuroscience, engineering, and physics. We are looking for highly motivated, creative, and independent researchers interested in developing, implementing, and using novel tools to address fundamental limitations in neurobiological research. These positions will require a broad set of skills, much of which can be learned in lab, that span engineering, neuroscience, and computation. In addition, we are looking for researchers that can clearly and effectively communicate across disciplines and fields.

All open positions will be a mix of tool development and neuroscience research with the amount of each tailored to an individual's interests. Tool development projects are directly motivated by open research questions and generally focused on advancing neural/behavioral recording/processing techniques in naturally behaving animals. Neuroscience research projects use tools and techniques developed in lab and generally focused around understanding Hippocampal CA1 function across space, time, and task. There are also many additional scientific avenues through our many collaborations with other neurobiology groups.


While not a prerequisite, previous experience in some or all of the following areas is a plus:

* Neurobiology:
  * Working with mice and/or rats
  * Viral injections
  * Neural implant surgeries
  * Neural imaging and processing techniques
  * Electrophysiology recording and processing techniques
  * Modeling
  * Analyzing neural and behavioral data
  * Machine learning
  
* Engineering:
  * PCB layout
  * CAD & CAM
  * Rapid Prototyping
  * Microcontroller programming
  * FPGA firmware
  * Data analysis
  * Programming and UI design
  * Optics design
  * Neural recording in behaving animals
  * Machine learning
 
* Physics:
  * Experimental design
  * Solid intuitions of the physical world
  * Computation and modelling

* Other:
  * Real-time processing
  * Open-source development, documentation, dissemination
  * Working with very large data
