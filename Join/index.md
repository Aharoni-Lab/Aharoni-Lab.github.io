The Aharoni Lab is currently seeking highly motivated and creative postdocs, graduate students, lab technicians, and undergraduates interested in tool development and neuroscience research. We are looking for people that have, or are interested in developing, skill sets that span across engineering *and* neuroscience and who are able to effectively communicate within both these fields.

While not a prerequisite, previous experience in some or all of the following areas is a plus:
* PCB layout
* CAD & CAM
* Rapid Prototyping
* Microcontroller programming
* FPGA firmware
* Data analysis
* Programming and UI design
* Optics design
* Neural recording in behaving animals
* Deep learning

**If interested, contact Daniel Aharoni, daharoni@mednet.ucla.edu.**
