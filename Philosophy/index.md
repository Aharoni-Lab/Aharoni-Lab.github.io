## Lab Mission

We aim to contribute to scientific understand through collaborative, responsible, and open science approaches. We also are committed to expanding global access to novel research tools and techniques through developing open-source systems that are both understandable and affordable. We believe democratizing access to transformative tools in neuroscience is critical, now more than ever, for pursuing productive and equitable science. The Lab is committed to developing well-rounded, robust, and proper experimental approaches and transfering that knowledge to trainees, collaborators, and the broader community.

## Expectations of all lab members
While we are all here to do research, that begins with an expectation to be kind, considerate, and helpful to others and, importantly, should form the foundation for all the work we do in lab. I expect everyone to actively work towards a collaborative, supportive environment where each person's skills and interests can be amplified by the team surrounding them. As researchers, everyone is expected to strive for rigor in their work, maintain the highest ethical standards, follow lab protocols, and exhibit integrity and creativity in problem solving. I expect lab members to work hard and demonstrate a strong commitment to their projects and the lab.

Communication in person, over Slack, on Zoom, and over email with lab members, university staff, or collaborators should always be respectful, supportive, and as clear as possible. Lab members are expected to be on time for scheduled meetings and actively participate in lab meetings and journal clubs. Lab members are expected to actively maintain and backup all their digital files/work on a well documented/commented lab GitHub repository in addition to maintaining well organized notes in a lab notebook.

Ask questions! The less you feel like you know, less comfortable you feel in a technical/scientific discussion, the more you are expected to ask questions. We should all never stop working towards being better researchers by asking questions and develping skills for how to navigate learning what we don't know.
