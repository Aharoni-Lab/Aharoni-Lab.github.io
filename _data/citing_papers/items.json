    "abstractNote": "Imaging live cells under stable culture conditions is essential to investigate cell physiological activities and proliferation. To achieve this goal, typically, a specialized incubation chamber that creates desired culture conditions needs to be incorporated into a microscopy system to perform cell monitoring. However, such imaging systems are generally large and costly, hampering their wide applications. Recent advances in the field of miniaturized microscopy systems have enabled incubator cell monitoring, providing a hospitable environment for live cells. Although these systems are more cost-effective, they are usually limited in imaging modalities and spatial temporal resolution. Here, we present a dual-mode, image-enhanced, miniaturized microscopy system (termed MiniCube) for direct monitoring of live cells inside incubators. MiniCube enables both bright field imaging and fluorescence imaging with single-cell spatial resolution and sub-second temporal resolution. Moreover, this system can also perform cell monitoring inside the incubator with tunable time scales ranging from a few seconds to days. Meanwhile, automatic cell segmentation and image enhancement are realized by the proposed data analysis pipeline of this system, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of acquired data is significantly improved using a deep learning based image denoising algorithm. Image data can be acquired with 5 times lower light exposure while maintaining comparable SNR. The versatility of this miniaturized microscopy system lends itself to various applications in biology studies, providing a practical platform and method for studying live cell dynamics within the incubator.",

    "abstractNote": "There is mounting evidence that the cerebellum impacts hippocampal functioning, but the impact of the cerebellum on hippocampal interneurons remains obscure. Using miniscopes in freely behaving animals, we find optogenetic stimulation of Purkinje cells alters the calcium activity of a large percentage of CA1 interneurons. This includes both increases and decreases in activity. Remarkably, this bidirectional impact occurs in a coordinated fashion, in line with interneurons’ functional properties. Specifically, CA1 interneurons activated by cerebellar stimulation are commonly locomotion-active, while those inhibited by cerebellar stimulation are commonly rest-active interneurons. We additionally find that subsets of CA1 interneurons show altered activity during object investigations, suggesting a role in the processing of objects in space. Importantly, these neurons also show coordinated modulation by cerebellar stimulation: CA1 interneurons that are activated by cerebellar stimulation are more likely to be activated, rather than inhibited, during object investigations, while interneurons that show decreased activity during cerebellar stimulation show the opposite profile. Therefore, CA1 interneurons play a role in object processing and in cerebellar impacts on the hippocampus, providing insight into previously noted altered CA1 processing of objects in space with cerebellar stimulation. We examined two different stimulation locations (IV/V Vermis; Simplex) and two different stimulation approaches (7Hz or a single 1s light pulse) – in all cases, the cerebellum induces similar coordinated CA1 interneuron changes congruent with an explorative state. Overall, our data show that the cerebellum impacts CA1 interneurons in a bidirectional and coordinated fashion, positioning them to play an important role in cerebello-hippocampal communication.\nSignificance Statement Acute manipulation of the cerebellum can affect the activity of cells in CA1, and perturbing normal cerebellar functioning can affect hippocampal-dependent spatial processing, including the processing of objects in space. Despite the importance of interneurons on the local hippocampal circuit, it was unknown how cerebellar activation impacts CA1 inhibitory neurons. We find that stimulating the cerebellum robustly affects multiple populations of CA1 interneurons in a bidirectional, coordinated manner, according to their functional profiles during behavior, including locomotion and object investigations. Our work also provides support for a role of CA1 interneurons in spatial processing of objects, with populations of interneurons showing altered activity during object investigations.",

    "abstractNote": "Taste-responsive neurons in the gustatory cortex (GC) have been shown to encode multiple properties of stimuli, including whether they are palatable or not. Previous studies have suggested that a form of taste-involved learning, conditioned taste aversion (CTA), may alter the cortical representation of taste stimuli in a number of ways. We used miniscopes to image taste responses from a large population of neurons in the gustatory cortex of mice before and after CTA to NaCl, comparing taste responses in control and conditioned mice. Following conditioning, no significant effects on the number of responsive cells, or the magnitude of response to either NaCl or other taste stimuli were found. However, population-level analyses showed that in mice receiving a CTA, the representation of NaCl diverged from other appetitive stimuli in neural space and moved closer to that of aversive quinine. We also tracked extinction of the CTA in a subset of animals and showed that as NaCl became less aversive, the neural pattern reverted to match the behavior. These data suggest that the predominant function of the taste representation in GC is palatability; the neuronal response pattern to stimuli at the population level reflects the decision of the animal to consume or not consume the stimulus, regardless of quality or chemical identity.",

    "abstractNote": "The cerebellum has been implicated in the regulation of social behavior. Its influence is thought to arise from communication, via the thalamus, to forebrain regions integral in the expression of social interactions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, the signals encoded or the nature of the communication between the cerebellum and these brain regions is poorly understood. Here, we describe an approach that overcomes technical challenges in exploring the coordination of distant brain regions at high temporal and spatial resolution during social behavior. We developed the E-Scope, an electrophysiology-integrated miniature microscope, to synchronously measure extracellular electrical activity in the cerebellum along with calcium imaging of the ACC. This single coaxial cable device combined these data streams to provide a powerful tool to monitor the activity of distant brain regions in freely behaving animals. During social behavior, we recorded the spike timing of multiple single units in cerebellar right Crus I (RCrus I) Purkinje cells (PCs) or dentate nucleus (DN) neurons while synchronously imaging calcium transients in contralateral ACC neurons. We found that during social interactions a significant subpopulation of cerebellar PCs were robustly inhibited, while most modulated neurons in the DN were activated, and their activity was correlated with positively modulated ACC neurons. These distinctions largely disappeared when only non-social epochs were analyzed suggesting that cerebellar-cortical interactions were behaviorally specific. Our work provides new insights into the complexity of cerebellar activation and co-modulation of the ACC during social behavior and a valuable open-source tool for simultaneous, multimodal recordings in freely behaving mice.",

    "abstractNote": "The human brain represents one of the most complex biological systems, containing billions of neurons interconnected through trillions of synapses. Inherent to the brain is a biochemical complexity involving ions, signaling molecules, and peptides that regulate neuronal activity and allow for short- and long-term adaptations. Large-scale and noninvasive imaging techniques, such as fMRI and EEG, have highlighted brain regions involved in specific functions and visualized connections between different brain areas. A major shortcoming, however, is the need for more information on specific cell types and neurotransmitters involved, as well as poor spatial and temporal resolution. Recent technologies have been advanced for neuronal circuit mapping and implemented in behaving model organisms to address this. Here, we highlight strategies for targeting specific neuronal subtypes, identifying, and releasing signaling molecules, controlling gene expression, and monitoring neuronal circuits in real-time in vivo. Combined, these approaches allow us to establish direct causal links from genes and molecules to the systems level and ultimately to cognitive processes.",

In particular, rats perform a wide range of sophisticated social, cognitive, motor, and learning behaviors within the contexts of both naturalistic and laboratory environments. Further progress in neuroscience can be facilitated by using advanced imaging methods to measure the complex neural and physiological processes during behavior in rats. However, compared with the mouse, the rat nervous system offers a set of challenges, such as larger brain size, decreased neuron density, and difficulty with head restraint. Here, we review recent advances in in vivo imaging techniques in rats with a special focus on open-source solutions for calcium imaging. Finally, we provide suggestions for both users and developers of in vivo imaging systems for rats.",

    "abstractNote": "Fluorescence microscopy imaging of live cells has provided consistent monitoring of dynamic cellular activities and interactions. However, because current live-cell imaging systems are limited in their adaptability, portable cell imaging systems have been adapted by a variety of strategies, including miniaturized fluorescence microscopy. Here, we provide a protocol for the construction and operational process of miniaturized modular-array fluorescence microscopy (MAM). The MAM system is built in a portable size (15c m×15c m×3c m) and provides in situ cell imaging inside an incubator with a subcellular lateral resolution (∼3µm). We demonstrated the improved stability of the MAM system with fluorescent targets and live HeLa cells, enabling long-term imaging for 12&#x00A0;h without the need for external support or post-processing. We believe the protocol could guide scientists to construct a compact portable fluorescence imaging system and perform time-lapse in situ single-cell imaging and analysis.",

    "abstractNote": "Hippocampus place cell discharge is temporally unreliable across seconds and days, and place fields are multimodal, suggesting an “ensemble cofiring” spatial coding hypothesis with manifold dynamics that does not require reliable spatial tuning, in contrast to hypotheses based on place field (spatial tuning) stability. We imaged mouse CA1 (cornu ammonis 1) ensembles in two environments across three weeks to evaluate these coding hypotheses. While place fields “remap,” being more distinct between than within environments, coactivity relationships generally change less. Decoding location and environment from 1-s ensemble location-specific activity is effective and improves with experience. Decoding environment from cell-pair coactivity relationships is also effective and improves with experience, even after removing place tuning. Discriminating environments from 1-s ensemble coactivity relies crucially on the cells with the most anti-coactive cell-pair relationships because activity is internally organized on a low-dimensional manifold of non-linear coactivity relationships that intermittently reregisters to environments according to the anti-cofiring subpopulation activity.",

    "abstractNote": "Deep-brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for patients suffering from otherwise therapy-resistant psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder. Modulation of cortico-striatal circuits has been suggested as a mechanism of action. To gain mechanistic insight, we monitored neuronal activity in cortico-striatal regions in a mouse model for compulsive behavior, while systematically varying clinically-relevant parameters of internal-capsule DBS. DBS showed dose-dependent effects on both brain and behavior: An increasing, yet balanced, number of excited and inhibited neurons was recruited, scattered throughout cortico-striatal regions, while excessive grooming decreased. Such neuronal recruitment did not alter basic brain function such as resting-state activity, and only occurred in awake animals, indicating a dependency on network activity. In addition to these widespread effects, we observed specific involvement of the medial orbitofrontal cortex in therapeutic outcomes, which was corroborated by optogenetic stimulation. Together, our findings provide mechanistic insight into how DBS exerts its therapeutic effects on compulsive behaviors.",

    "abstractNote": "Aversive stimuli can cause hippocampal place cells to remap their firing fields, but it is not known whether remapping plays a role in storing memories of aversive experiences. Here, we addressed this question by performing in vivo calcium imaging of CA1 place cells in freely behaving rats (n = 14). Rats were first trained to prefer a short path over a long path for obtaining food reward, then trained to avoid the short path by delivering a mild footshock. Remapping was assessed by comparing place cell population vector similarity before acquisition versus after extinction of avoidance. Some rats received shock after systemic injections of the amnestic drug scopolamine at a dose (1 mg/kg) that impaired avoidance learning but spared spatial tuning and shock-evoked responses of CA1 neurons. Place cells remapped significantly more following remembered than forgotten shocks (drug-free versus scopolamine conditions); shock-induced remapping did not cause place fields to migrate toward or away from the shocked location and was similarly prevalent in cells that were responsive versus non-responsive to shocks. When rats were exposed to a neutral barrier rather than aversive shock, place cells remapped significantly less in response to the barrier. We conclude that place cell remapping occurs in response to events that are remembered rather than merely perceived and forgotten, suggesting that reorganization of hippocampal population codes may play a role in storing memories for aversive events.",

    "abstractNote": "Vector coding is becoming increasingly understood as a major mechanism by which neural systems represent an animal’s location in both a global reference frame and a local, item-based reference frame. Landmark vector cells (LVCs) in the hippocampus complement classic place cells by encoding the vector relationship (angle and distance) between the individual and specific landmarks in the environment. How these properties of hippocampal principal cells interact is not known. We simultaneously recorded the activities of place cells and LVCs via in vivo calcium imaging of the CA1 region of freely moving rats during classic, cue-card rotation studies. The firing fields of place cells rotated relative to the center of the platform to follow the cue card rotation, whereas the firing fields of simultaneously recorded LVCs rotated by the same amount as the place cells, but the axis of rotation was the nearby local landmarks, not the environmental center. We identified a novel type of place cell that exhibited conjunctive coding of the classic place field properties and LVC properties. These results demonstrate the capacity of CA1 neurons to encode both world-centered spatial information and animals’ location relative to the local landmarks, with a common directional input presumably provided by the head direction cell system.",

    "abstractNote": "Recent long-term optical imaging studies have demonstrated that the activity levels of hippocampal neurons in a familiar environment change on a daily to weekly basis. However, it is unclear whether there is any time-invariant property in the cells’ neural representations. In this study, using miniature fluorescence microscopy, we measured the neural activity of the mouse hippocampus in four different environments every 3 d. Although the activity level of hippocampal neurons fluctuated greatly in each environment across days, we found a significant correlation between the activity levels for different days, and the correlation was higher for averaged activity levels across multiple environments. When the number of environments used for averaging was increased, a higher activity correlation was observed. Furthermore, the number of environments in which a cell showed activity was preserved. Cells that showed place cell activity in many environments had greater spatial information content and more stable spatial representation, and thus carried more abundant and stable information about the current position. In contrast, cells that were active only in a small number of environments provided sparse representation for the environment. These results suggest that each cell has not only an inherent activity level but also play a characteristic role in the coding of space.",

We present a large-field-of-view open-source miniature microscope (MiniLFOV) designed for large-scale (3.6 mm × 2.7 mm), cellular resolution neural imaging in freely behaving rats. It has an electrically adjustable working distance of up to 3.5 mm ± 100 μm, incorporates an absolute head orientation sensor, and weighs only 13.9 g. The MiniLFOV is capable of both deep brain and cortical imaging and has been validated in freely behaving rats by simultaneously imaging >1000 GCaMP7s-expressing neurons in the hippocampal CA1 layer and in head-fixed mice by simultaneously imaging ~2000 neurons in the dorsal cortex through a cranial window. The MiniLFOV also supports optional wire-free operation using a novel, wire-free data acquisition expansion board. We expect that this new open-source implementation of the UCLA Miniscope platform will enable researchers to address novel hypotheses concerning brain function in freely behaving animals.",

    "abstractNote": "Fronto-striatal circuits have been implicated in cognitive control of behavioral output for social and appetitive rewards. The functional diversity of prefrontal cortical populations is strongly dependent on their synaptic targets, with control of motor output mediated by connectivity to dorsal striatum. Despite evidence for functional diversity along the anterior-posterior striatal axis, it is unclear how distinct fronto-striatal sub-circuits support value-based choice. Here we found segregated prefrontal populations defined by anterior/posterior dorsomedial striatal target. During a feedback-based 2-alternative choice task, single-photon imaging revealed circuit-specific representations of task-relevant information with prelimbic neurons targeting anterior DMS (PL::A-DMS) robustly modulated during choices and negative outcomes, while prelimbic neurons targeting posterior DMS (PL::P-DMS) encoded internal representations of value and positive outcomes contingent on prior choice. Consistent with this distributed coding, optogenetic inhibition of PL::A-DMS circuits strongly impacted choice monitoring and responses to negative outcomes while inhibition of PL::P-DMS impaired task engagement and strategies following positive outcomes. Together our data uncover PL populations engaged in distributed processing for value-based choice.",

By integrating digital micromirrors, the endoscope makes it possible to activate any neuron of choice within the field of view, and to apply arbitrary spatiotemporal patterns of photostimulation while imaging calcium activity. We used the endoscope to image striatal neurons from either the direct pathway or the indirect pathway in freely moving mice while activating any chosen neuron in the field of view. The endoscope also allows for the selection of neurons based on their relationship with specific animal behaviour, and to recreate the behaviour by mimicking the natural neural activity with photostimulation. The miniaturized endoscope may facilitate the study of how neural activity gives rise to behaviour in freely moving animals.",

    "abstractNote": "Memory-updating is critical in dynamic environments because updating memories with new information promotes versatility. However, little is known about how memories are updated with new information. To study how neuronal ensembles might support memory-updating, we used a hippocampus-dependent spatial reversal task to measure hippocampal ensemble dynamics when mice switched navigational goals. Using Miniscope calcium imaging, we identified neuronal ensembles (co-active neurons) in dorsal CA1 that were spatially tuned and stable across training sessions. When reward locations were moved during a reversal session, a subset of these ensembles decreased their activation strength, correlating with memory-updating. These “remodeling” ensembles were a result of weakly-connected neurons becoming less co-active with their peers. Middle-aged mice were impaired in reversal learning, and the prevalence of their remodeling ensembles correlated with their memory-updating performance. Therefore, we have identified a mechanism where the hippocampus breaks down ensembles to support memory-updating.",

    "abstractNote": "The head direction (HD) system functions as the brain’s internal compass1,2, classically formalized as a one-dimensional ring attractor network3,4. In contrast to a globally consistent magnetic compass, the HD system does not have a universal reference frame. Instead, it anchors to local cues, maintaining a stable offset when cues rotate5–8 and drifting in the absence of referents5,8–10. However, questions about the mechanisms that underlie anchoring and drift remain unresolved and are best addressed at the population level. For example, the extent to which the one-dimensional description of population activity holds under conditions of reorientation and drift is unclear. Here we performed population recordings of thalamic HD cells using calcium imaging during controlled rotations of a visual landmark. Across experiments, population activity varied along a second dimension, which we refer to as network gain, especially under circumstances of cue conflict and ambiguity. Activity along this dimension predicted realignment and drift dynamics, including the speed of network realignment. In the dark, network gain maintained a ‘memory trace’ of the previously displayed landmark. Further experiments demonstrated that the HD network returned to its baseline orientation after brief, but not longer, exposures to a rotated cue. This experience dependence suggests that memory of previous associations between HD neurons and allocentric cues is maintained and influences the internal HD representation. Building on these results, we show that continuous rotation of a visual landmark induced rotation of the HD representation that persisted in darkness, demonstrating experience-dependent recalibration of the HD system. Finally, we propose a computational model to formalize how the neural compass flexibly adapts to changing environmental cues to maintain a reliable representation of HD. These results challenge classical one-dimensional interpretations of the HD system and provide insights into the interactions between this system and the cues to which it anchors.",

    "abstractNote": "Epifluorescence miniature microscopes (‘miniscopes’) are widely used for in vivo calcium imaging of neural population activity. Imaging data are typically collected during a behavioral task and stored for later offline analysis, but emerging techniques for online imaging can support novel closed-loop experiments in which neural population activity is decoded in real time to trigger neurostimulation or sensory feedback. To achieve short feedback latencies, online imaging systems must be optimally designed to maximize computational speed and efficiency while minimizing errors in population decoding. Here we introduce DeCalciOn, an open-source device for real-time imaging and population decoding of in vivo calcium signals that is hardware compatible with all miniscopes that use the UCLA Data Acquisition (DAQ) interface. DeCalciOn performs online motion stabilization, neural enhancement, calcium trace extraction, and decoding of up to 1024 traces per frame at latencies of <50 ms after fluorescence photons arrive at the miniscope image sensor. We show that DeCalciOn can accurately decode the position of rats (n = 12) running on a linear track from calcium fluorescence in the hippocampal CA1 layer, and can categorically classify behaviors performed by rats (n = 2) during an instrumental task from calcium fluorescence in orbitofrontal cortex. DeCalciOn achieves high decoding accuracy at short latencies using innovations such as field-programmable gate array hardware for real-time image processing and contour-free methods to efficiently extract calcium traces from sensor images. In summary, our system offers an affordable plug-and-play solution for real-time calcium imaging experiments in behaving animals.",

Miniature microscopes, as revolutionary approaches, enable the imaging of large populations of neuron ensembles in freely behaving rodents and mammals, which allows exploring the neural basis of behaviors. Recent progress in two-photon miniature microscopes and mesoscale single-photon miniature microscopes further expand those affordable methods to navigate neural activities during naturalistic behaviors. In this review article, two-photon miniature microscopy techniques are summarized historically from the first documented attempt to the latest ones, and comparisons are made. The driving force behind and their potential for neuroscientific inquiries are also discussed. Current progress in terms of the mesoscale, i.e., the large field-of-view miniature microscopy technique, is addressed as well. Then, pipelines for registering single cells from the data of two-photon and large field-of-view miniature microscopes are discussed. Finally, we present the potential evolution of the techniques.",

    "abstractNote": "In the face of imminent predatory danger, animals quickly detect the threat and mobilize key survival defensive actions, such as escape and freezing. The dorsomedial portion of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) is a central node in innate and conditioned predator-induced defensive behaviours. Prior studies have shown that activity of steroidogenic factor 1 (sf1)-expressing VMH cells is necessary for such defensive behaviours. However, sf1-VMH neural activity during exposure to predatory threats has not been well characterized. Here, we use single-cell recordings of calcium transients from VMH cells in male and female mice. We show this region is activated by threat proximity and that it encodes future occurrence of escape but not freezing. Our data also show that VMH cells encoded proximity of an innate predatory threat but not a fear-conditioned shock grid. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of the VMH increases avoidance of innate threats, such as open spaces and a live predator. This manipulation also increased freezing towards the predator, without altering defensive behaviours induced by a shock grid. Lastly, we show that optogenetic VMH activation recruited a broad swath of regions, suggestive of widespread changes in neural defensive state. Taken together, these data reveal the neural dynamics of the VMH during predator exposure and further highlight its role as a critical component of the hypothalamic predator defense system.",

    "abstractNote": "The ability to measure neural activity patterns and relate them to behavior is fundamental to the advancement of neuroscience. Miniature microscope (miniscope) technology has made a significant contribution to this endeavor by allowing researchers to record neural activity from thousands of neurons with single-cell resolution in freely behaving animals across days to months. However, while this technology has allowed scientists to readily acquire immense and theoretically illuminating datasets, data analysis remains a bottleneck for adopting miniscope technology. In addition, currently miniscopes can only image one fluororphore at a time, limiting the scope of applications. Hence, development of novel software and hardware that expand the existing capabilities of miniscopes and make the technology more accessible will be of great value to neuroscience.\nOne of the biggest challenges in adopting Miniscope technology is data analysis. We developed an open-source calcium imaging analysis pipeline, Minian, with interactive visualizations and reduced memory demand. By providing interactive visualization, detailed documentation, and guidance for each step in the pipeline, Minian helps users build intuitive understanding of the underlying algorithms and readily perform accurate parameter selection. This greatly improved the accessibility of calcium imaging analysis to neuroscience researchers. Moreover, Minian supports out-of-core computation, allowing data larger than the RAM of the computer to be processed. This enables researchers to analyze data with arbitrary recording length without specialized computer hardware. Taken together, these features made Minian more transparent, accessible and user-friendly.\nTraditionally, Miniscopes were only capable to image one fluorophore. However, with the advancement of new genetic tools, there is a growing need to image multiple fluorophores simultaneously at single-cell resolution. Here, we describe a novel open-source dual-channel Miniscope developed to fill this gap in current technologies. Our design can correct for focal plane mismatch due to chromatic aberration and is light enough to be carried by adult mice, enabling dual-channel calcium imaging in behaving animals. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a use case where our dual-channel Miniscope can be used to track the same population of neurons across long time and study the stability of hippocampal spatial representation in an unbiased way.\nTaken together, we have described the development and dissemination of novel open-source Miniscope software and hardware that fill gaps in the field and make the technology more impactful.",

Because the hippocampus (HPC) is essential for tasks of memory, spatial navigation, and learning, calcium imaging of large populations of HPC neurons can provide new insight on cell changes over time during these tasks. All reported HPC in vivo calcium imaging experiments have been done in mouse. However, rats have many behavioral and physiological experimental advantages over mice. In this paper, we present the first (to our knowledge) in vivo calcium imaging from CA1 HPC in freely moving male rats. Using the UCLA Miniscope, we demonstrate that, in rat, hundreds of cells can be visualized and held across weeks. We show that calcium events in these cells are highly correlated with periods of movement, with few calcium events occurring during periods without movement. We additionally show that an extremely large percent of cells recorded during a navigational task are place cells (77.3 ± 5.0%, surpassing the percent seen during mouse calcium imaging), and that these cells enable accurate decoding of animal position and can be held over days with consistent place fields in a consistent spatial map. A detailed protocol is included, and implications of these advancements on in vivo imaging and place field literature are discussed.\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In vivo calcium imaging in freely moving animals allows the visualization of cellular activity across days. In this paper, we present the first in vivo Ca2+ recording from CA1 hippocampus (HPC) in freely moving rats. We demonstrate that hundreds of cells can be visualized and held across weeks, and that calcium activity corresponds to periods of movement. We show that a high percentage (77.3 ± 5.0%) of imaged cells are place cells, and that these place cells enable accurate decoding and can be held stably over days with little change in field location. Because the HPC is essential for many tasks involving memory, navigation, and learning, imaging of large populations of HPC neurons can shed new insight on cellular activity changes and organization.",

Paired with the rapidly developing technologies for brain imaging and manipulations of brain activity, operant conditioning chambers are a powerful tool for neuroscience research. The behavioral testing and imaging setups that are commercially available are often quite costly. Here, we present a custom-built operant chamber that can be constructed in a few days by an unexperienced user with relatively inexpensive, widely available materials. The advantages of our operant setup compared with other open-source and closed-source solutions are its relatively low cost, its support of complex behavioral tasks, its user-friendly setup, and its validated functionality with video imaging of behavior and calcium imaging using the UCLA Miniscope. Using this setup, we replicate our previously published findings showing that mice exposed to social defeat stress in adolescence have inhibitory control impairments in the Go/No-Go task when they reach adulthood. We also present calcium imaging data of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neuronal activity acquired during Go/No-Go testing in freely moving mice and show that neuronal population activity increases from day 1 to day 14 of the task. We propose that our operant chamber is a cheaper alternative to its commercially available counterparts and offers a better balance between versatility and user-friendly setup than other open-source alternatives.",

    "abstractNote": "In order to respond appropriately to threats in the environment, the brain must rapidly determine whether a stimulus is important and whether it is positive or negative, and then use that information to direct behavioral responses. Neurons in the amygdala have long been implicated in valence encoding and in fear responses to threatening stimuli, but show transient firing responses in response to these stimuli that do not match the timescales of associated behavioral responses. For decades, there has been a logical gap in how behavioral responses could be mediated without an ensemble representation of the internal state of valence that has rapid onset, high signal-to-noise, and is sustained for the duration of the behavioral state. Here, we present the amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) as a missing piece of this highly conserved process that is of paramount importance for survival, which does exactly this: represents an internal state (e.g. fear) that can be expressed in multiple motor outputs (e.g. freezing or escape). The ASt is anatomically positioned as a “shortcut” to connect the corticolimbic system (important for evaluation) with the basal ganglia (important for action selection) with the inputs of the amygdala and the outputs of the striatum – ideally poised for evaluating and responding to environmental threats. From in vivo cellular resolution recordings that include both electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we find that ASt neurons are unique in that they are sparse coding, extremely high signal-to-noise, and also maintain a sustained response for negative valence stimuli for the duration of the defensive behavior – a rare but essential combination. We further show that photostimulation of the ASt is sufficient to drive freezing and avoidance behaviors. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and in situ RNA labelling we generate a comprehensive profile of cell types and gene expression in the ASt, and find the ASt is genetically distinct from adjacent striatal and amygdalar structures. We also find that the ASt has a greater proportion of neurons expressing Drd2 than neurons expressing Drd1a, a unique feature compared to other regions of the striatum. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we show that that this Drd2+ population robustly encodes stimuli of negative valence, and in loss-of-function experiments find that optogenetic inhibition of Drd2+ ASt neurons causes a striking reduction in cue-conditioned fear responses. Together, our findings identify the ASt as a previously-unappreciated critical missing link for encoding learned associations and directing ongoing behavior.",

    "abstractNote": "As the use of Radio Frequency (RF) technologies increases, the impact of RF radiation on neurological function continues to receive attention. Whether RF radiation can modulate ongoing neuronal activity by non-thermal mechanisms has been debated for decades. However, the interactions between radiated energy and metal-based neural probes during experimentation could impact neural activity, making interpretation of the results difficult. To address this problem, we modified a miniature 1-photon Ca2+ imaging device to record interference-free neural activity and compared the results to those acquired using metal-containing silicon probes. We monitored the neuronal activity of awake rodent-brains under RF energy exposure (at 950 MHz) and in sham control paradigms. Spiking activity was reliably affected by RF energy in metal containing systems. However, we did not observe neuronal responses using metal-free optical recordings at induced local electric field strengths up to 230 V/m. Our results suggest that RF exposure higher than levels that are allowed by regulatory limits in real-life scenarios do not affect neuronal activity.",

    "abstractNote": "<p>Single-photon-based head-mounted microscopy is widely used to record the brain activities of freely-moving animals. However, during data acquisition, the free movement of animals will cause shaking in the field of view, which deteriorates subsequent neural signal analyses. Existing motion correction methods applied to calcium imaging data either focus on offline analyses or lack sufficient accuracy in real-time processing for single-photon data. In this study, we proposed an open-source real-time motion correction (RTMC) plug-in for single-photon calcium imaging data acquisition. The RTMC plug-in is a real-time subpixel registration algorithm that can run GPUs in UCLA Miniscope data acquisition software. When used with the UCLA Miniscope, the RTMC algorithm satisfies real-time processing requirements in terms of speed, memory, and accuracy. We tested the RTMC algorithm by extending a manual neuron labeling function to extract calcium signals in a real experimental setting. The results demonstrated that the neural calcium dynamics and calcium events can be restored with high accuracy from the calcium data that were collected by the UCLA Miniscope system embedded with our RTMC plug-in. Our method could become an essential component in brain science research, where real-time brain activity is needed for closed-loop experiments.</p>",

    "abstractNote": "The invention of the miniaturized microscope has enabled neuroscientists to investigate neural mechanisms in freely moving mice. A lot of efforts have been made to optimize performance of the miniaturized microscope. However, the tethered cables limit the ability of mini-microscope systems to record neural activity from multiple mice simultaneously. Here, we present a wireless mini-microscope (wScope) that enables both real-time remote control and data preview during animal behavior; this design also supports simultaneous recording from up to 8 mice. The wScope has a mass of 2.7 g and a maximum frame rate of 25 Hz at 750 μm by 450 μm field of view with 1.8 μm resolution. We validated the wScopes in video-recording of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the activity of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of different mice. The wScope provides a powerful tool for brain imaging of free moving animals, including large primates, in their much larger spaces and more naturalistic environments.",

    "abstractNote": "The CA1 region of the hippocampus contains both glutamatergic pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons. Numerous reports have characterized glutamatergic CAMK2A cell activity, showing how these cells respond to environmental changes such as local cue rotation and context re-sizing. Additionally, the long-term stability of spatial encoding and turnover of these cells across days is also well-characterized. In contrast, these classic hippocampal experiments have never been conducted with CA1 GABAergic cells. Here, we use chronic calcium imaging of male and female mice to compare the neural activity of VGAT and CAMK2A cells during exploration of unaltered environments and also during exposure to contexts before and after rotating and changing the length of the context across multiple recording days. Intriguingly, compared to CAMK2A cells, VGAT cells showed decreased remapping induced by environmental changes, such as context rotations and contextual length resizing. However, GABAergic neurons were also less likely than glutamatergic neurons to remain active and exhibit consistent place coding across recording days. Interestingly, despite showing significant spatial remapping across days, GABAergic cells had stable speed encoding between days. Thus, compared to glutamatergic cells, spatial encoding of GABAergic cells is more stable during within-session environmental perturbations, but is less stable across days. These insights may be crucial in accurately modeling the features and constraints of hippocampal dynamics in spatial coding.",

    "abstractNote": "Miniature microscopes have gained considerable traction for in vivo calcium imaging in freely behaving animals. However, extracting calcium signals from raw videos is a computationally complex problem and remains a bottleneck for many researchers utilizing single-photon in vivo calcium imaging. Despite the existence of many powerful analysis packages designed to detect and extract calcium dynamics, most have either key parameters that are hard-coded or insufficient step-by-step guidance and validations to help the users choose the best parameters. This makes it difficult to know whether the output is reliable and meets the assumptions necessary for proper analysis. Moreover, large memory demand is often a constraint for setting up these pipelines since it limits the choice of hardware to specialized computers. Given these difficulties, there is a need for a low memory demand, user-friendly tool offering interactive visualizations of how altering parameters at each step of the analysis affects data output. Our open-source analysis pipeline, Minian (miniscope analysis), facilitates the transparency and accessibility of single-photon calcium imaging analysis, permitting users with little computational experience to extract the location of cells and their corresponding calcium traces and deconvolved neural activities. Minian contains interactive visualization tools for every step of the analysis, as well as detailed documentation and tips on parameter exploration. Furthermore, Minian has relatively small memory demands and can be run on a laptop, making it available to labs that do not have access to specialized computational hardware. Minian has been validated to reliably and robustly extract calcium events across different brain regions and from different cell types. In practice, Minian provides an open-source calcium imaging analysis pipeline with user-friendly interactive visualizations to explore parameters and validate results.",

    "abstractNote": "Environmental enrichment induces widespread neuronal changes, but the initiation of the cascade is unknown. We ascertained the critical period of divergence between environmental enriched (EE) and standard environment (SE) mice using continuous infrared (IR) videography, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and neuron level calcium imaging. Naïve adult male mice (n = 285, C57BL/6J, postnatal day 60) were divided into SE and EE groups. We assessed the linear time-series of motion activity using a novel structural break test which examined the dataset for change in circadian and day-by-day motion activity. fMRI was used to map brain-wide response using a functional connectome analysis pipeline. Awake calcium imaging was performed on the dorsal CA1 pyramidal layer. We found the preeminent behavioral feature in EE was a forward shift in the circadian rhythm, prolongation of activity in the dark photoperiod, and overall decreased motion activity. The crepuscular period of dusk was seen as the critical period of divergence between EE and SE mice. The functional processes at dusk in EE included increased functional connectivity in the visual cortex, motor cortex, retrosplenial granular cortex, and cingulate cortex using seed-based analysis. Network based statistics found a modulated functional connectome in EE concentrated in two hubs: the hippocampal formation and isocortical network. These hubs experienced a higher node degree and significant enhanced edge connectivity. Calcium imaging revealed increased spikes per second and maximum firing rate in the dorsal CA1 pyramidal layer, in addition to location (anterior-posterior and medial-lateral) effect size differences between EE and SE. The emergence of functional-neuronal changes due to enrichment consisted of enhanced hippocampal-isocortex functional connectivity and CA1 neuronal increased spiking linked to a circadian shift during the dusk period. Future studies should explore the molecular consequences of enrichment inducing shifts in the circadian period.",

    "abstractNote": "This thesis investigates the electrophysiological correlates of the hippocampus and medial\nprefrontal cortex to auditory activity, either in an animal model of tinnitus induced by highdose salicylate or in the response to loud broadband noise in mice during locomotion. The\nresults are organized into four chapters with three experimental articles (chapter 1-3, with 2\npublished articles and one manuscript in preparation) and one book protocol (chapter 4, preprint). In the first article (Winne et al. 2019), we found that a high dose of salicylate\n(300mg/kg) induced type 2 theta (4-6Hz) oscillation in the ventral hippocampus (VHipp) as\nwell as elicits anxiety-like behavior in mice. In addition, high dose salicylate administration\nabolished dorsal hippocampus (DHipp) type 1 theta (7-10Hz) correlation with running speed.\nIn the second article (Winne et al. 2020), we showed that after pretreatment with salicylate,\nonly young mice with preserved hearing exhibited anxiety-like behavior, compared to old\nmice. We hypothesize that old C57BL/6 mice might already have altered hearing due to agerelated hearing loss, and thus are less likely to present salicylate-induced tinnitus and tinnitusrelated anxiety. In young mice, an increase in type 2 theta oscillations and slow gamma (30-\n60Hz) was observed in the VHipp, as well as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), after\nsalicylate treatment during the open field and in the elevated plus-maze. Furthermore, we also\nnoticed an increased theta 2 coherence between VHipp and mPFC during the tasks. Lastly,\npretreatment of mice with a single dose of the psychedelic substance 5-MeO-DMT prevented\nthe emergence of anxiety-associated behaviors and the induction of type 2 theta and slow\ngamma after salicylate injection. Based on electrophysiological and behavioral evidence,\narticles 1 and 2 indicate that anxiety-related mechanisms are triggered in the salicylate-model\nof tinnitus. Chapter 3 focuses on mice with normal hearing, specifically how loud noise\nstimuli modulates limbic circuits, and the Reticular-limbic auditory pathway. Using\ncombined approaches (silence/noise, chemo- and optogenetics), type 1 theta oscillations (7-\n10Hz) of the DHipp were shown to be accelerated by loud broadband noise. Specifically,\nnoise input relayed from the entorhinal cortex, and medial septum could modulate DHipp\ntheta 1 oscillations while decreasing the activity of the auditory cortex did not affect this noncanonical pathway of loud noise processing. We also verified that the activation of this\npathway increased coherence between the DHipp and medial prefrontal cortex. We\nhypothesize that increasing the activity of DHipp neurons through loud auditory stimuli could\nbe a biological strategy to quickly identify dangerous environments and increase the alertness\nof animals in response to possible surrounding threats. Lastly, in Chapter 4 (Winne et al.,\n2021, pre-print), we discuss a technique of calcium imaging of freely moving animals, using\nminiaturised microendoscopes (‘miniscopes’) and describe in detail the lens and baseplate\nimplant surgery for the UCLA Miniscope V3 and V4. We used a gradient index (GRIN) lens\nfor the hippocampus and a combination of a prism and GRIN lens for the auditory and motor\ncortex, with adaptations from published work for an improved lens fixation (GRIN-relayPrism). Finally, we comment on the differences between analysis software. In conclusion,\nthis thesis demonstrates electrophysiological correlates of salicylate-induced tinnitus that\nstrengthen the neurobiological link between tinnitus and anxiety. More so, limbic pathways\nrelaying loud noise information were also shown to modulate the activity of the hippocampus\nand the medial prefrontal cortex. Together these results evidence new electrophysiological\nsignatures of sound processing in the limbic system.",

    "abstractNote": "Widefield microscope provides optical access to multi-millimeter fields of view and thousands of neurons in mammalian brains at video rate. However, calcium imaging at cellular resolution has been mostly contaminated by tissue scattering and background signals, making neuronal activities extraction challenging and time-consuming. Here we present a deep widefield neuron finder (DeepWonder), which is fueled by simulated calcium recordings but effectively works on experimental data with an order of magnitude faster speed and improved inference accuracy than traditional approaches. The efficient DeepWonder accomplished fifty-fold signal-to-background ratio enhancement in processing terabytes-scale cortex-wide recording, with over 14000 neurons extracted in 17 hours in workstation-grade computing resources compared to nearly week-long processing time with previous methods. DeepWonder circumvented the numerous computational resources and could serve as a guideline to massive data processing in widefield neuronal imaging.",

    "abstractNote": "Although Alzheimer’s disease was first identified in 1906 by Alois Alzheimer the\nextensive pathophysiology that produces the disease is still poorly understood. It is a\nneurodegenerative disorder characterised by a marked reduction in the volume of the cerebral\ncortex and hippocampus, which produces general mental decline including memory loss and\nconfusion, inability to create new memories, behavioural changes, and eventual death.\nTherefore, the primary aim of this project was to investigate neuronal calcium network\ndynamics responsible for memory deficits with simultaneous behavioural in transgenic mice\n[APPswe/PS1dE9] through the utilisation of head-mountable miniaturised microscopes.\nTo image activity in the hippocampus mice were virally injected with the calcium\nactivity reporter (GCaMP7) into the CA1, a GRIN lens was implanted superiorly for optical\naccess, and a baseplate was secured to the skull to allow the future attachment of a miniscope.\nMale transgenic and non-transgenic littermate mice aged 15-17 months underwent open field,\ny-maze, and novel object recognition behaviour tests. These cognitive assessments query\nanxiety and fear (time spent in the exterior region and freezing in open field), short-term spatial\nmemory (alternations in y-maze and novel object location), and short-term and long-term\nobject memory (novel object recognition). Neuronal dynamics were simultaneously recorded\nthrough in vivo miniscope imaging of GCaMP7 expressing hippocampal CA1 neurons.\nNeuronal dynamics (mean amplitude, frequency, spike width, participation, and location\nspecific firing) were examined, correlated with behaviour, and compared across genotypes.\nWhen examining two separate cohorts there were significant phenotypical differences\nbetween transgenic and wildtype regarding ambulation, open field anxiety and freezing, ymaze\nand novel object location short-term spatial memory measures, and novel object shortterm\nand long-term object memory measures. There were also significant differences between\ngenotypes in mean spike width and participation – with aged transgenic mice exhibiting\nneuronal hyperactivity. Additionally, when staining for amyloid-β plaques (a hallmark\nhistology marker) were witnessed in the transgenic hippocampus and cortex but not wildtype.\nThis project in conjunction with previous work has established a protocol that permits\nqueries into the underlying neuropathology to link behavioural deficits to neuronal changes.",

    "abstractNote": "Calcium imaging is a technique that detects the transient changes of calcium ions during an action potential. It enables researchers to record thousands of neurons simultaneously. However, researchers require a method of tracking individual neurons across different recordings for analyses; this problem is known as cell registration. Current approaches rely on image alignment and statistical correlations to perform cell registration. However, these approaches are often slow and require tuning when used on novel datasets. Our end-to-end approach begins with the generation of semi-synthetic data from a few real calcium recordings examples. This allows the option of creating a dataset of any size to train a deep learning model that performs cell registration. We tested three network architectures that are specialized for image patch comparisons to perform cell registration: Siamese, 2-channel, and center-surround networks. These networks were trained once using only semi-synthetic data and were tested on real held-out datasets. The three models were evaluated on a hand-annotated Chronic Social Defeat Stress dataset and were compared to an existing cell registration approach, CellReg. Our best model, center-surround, achieved an average accuracy of 80.17% while maintaining a precision score of 0.8982. Unlike previous methods, our end-to-end method introduces a new approach of generating synthetic neuronal data that mimics real world data. Next, we show that the cell registration problem can be structured as a binary classification problem to be solved by a deep learning model. Therefore, with our generated synthetic data, we train deep learning models that reliably map neurons across recordings in a scalable manner while requiring minimal parameter tuning. Our contribution includes a versatile approach to cell registration that introduces a novel way of generating semi-synthetic data which is used to train a deep learning model to reliably match cells from raw imaging data.\nAlternate abstract:\nLUimagerie calcigue est une techniğue gui dötecte les changements transitoires des ions calcium pendant un potentiel d'action.

    "abstractNote": "Naturalistic escape requires versatile context-specific flight with rapid evaluation of local geometry to identify and use efficient escape routes. It is unknown how spatial navigation and escape circuits are recruited to produce context-specific flight. Using mice, we show activity in cholecystokinin-expressing hypothalamic dorsal premammillary cells (PMd-cck) is sufficient and necessary for context-specific escape that adapts to each environment’s layout. Contrastingly, numerous other nuclei implicated in flight only induced stereotyped panic-related escape. We reasoned the PMd can induce context-specific escape because it projects to both escape and spatial navigation nuclei. Indeed, activity in PMd-cck projections to thalamic spatial navigation circuits are only necessary for context-specific escape induced by moderate threats, but not panic-related stereotyped escape caused by perceived asphyxiation. Conversely, the PMd projection to the escape-inducing dorsal periaqueductal gray projection is necessary for all escapes tested. Thus, PMd-cck controls versatile flight, engaging spatial navigation and escape circuits.\nIt is additionally unknown if a single circuit controls escape vigor from innate and conditioned threats. We further demonstrate that PMd-cck cells are activated during escape, but not other defensive behaviors. PMd-cck ensemble activity can also predict future escape. Furthermore, PMd inhibition decreases escape speed from both innate and conditioned threats. Inhibition of the PMd-cck projection to the dlPAG also decreased escape speed. Intriguingly, PMd- cck and dlPAG activity in mice showed higher mutual information during exposure to innate and conditioned threats. In parallel, human fMRI data show that a posterior hypothalamic-to-dlPAG pathway increased activity during exposure to aversive images, indicating that a similar pathway may possibly have a related role in humans. Our data identify the PMd-dlPAG circuit as a central node, controlling escape vigor elicited by both innate and conditioned threats.",

    "abstractNote": "The brainstem dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) has been widely recognized as being a vital node orchestrating the responses to innate threats. Intriguingly, recent evidence also shows that the dPAG mediates defensive responses to fear conditioned contexts. However, it is unknown whether the dPAG displays independent or shared patterns of activation during exposure to innate and conditioned threats. It is also unclear how dPAG ensembles encode and predict diverse defensive behaviors. To address this question, we used miniaturized microscopes to obtain recordings of the same dPAG ensembles during exposure to a live predator and a fear conditioned context in male mice. dPAG ensembles encoded not only distance to threat, but also relevant features, such as predator speed and angular offset between mouse and threat. Furthermore, dPAG cells accurately encoded numerous defensive behaviors, including freezing, stretch-attend postures, and escape. Encoding of behaviors and of distance to threat occurred independently in dPAG cells. dPAG cells also displayed a shared representation to encode these behaviors and distance to threat across innate and conditioned threats. Last, we also show that escape could be predicted by dPAG activity several seconds in advance. Thus, dPAG activity dynamically tracks key kinematic and behavioral variables during exposure to threats, and exhibits similar patterns of activation during defensive behaviors elicited by innate or conditioned threats. These data indicate that a common pathway may be recruited by the dPAG during exposure to a wide variety of threat modalities.\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) is critical to generate defensive behaviors during encounters with threats of multiple modalities. Here we use longitudinal calcium transient recordings of dPAG ensembles in freely moving mice to show that this region uses shared patterns of activity to represent distance to an innate threat (a live predator) and a conditioned threat (a shock grid). We also show that dPAG neural activity can predict diverse defensive behaviors. These data indicate the dPAG uses conserved population-level activity patterns to encode and coordinate defensive behaviors during exposure to both innate and conditioned threats.",

    "abstractNote": "Neuroscientists use miniature microscopes (miniscopes) to observe neuronal activity in freely behaving animals. The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Miniscope team provides open resources for researchers to build miniscopes themselves. The V3 UCLA Miniscope is one of the most popular open-source miniscopes currently in use. It permits imaging of the fluorescence transients emitted from genetically modified neurons through an objective lens implanted on the superficial cortex (a one-lens system), or in deep brain areas through a combination of a relay lens implanted in the deep brain and an objective lens that is preanchored in the miniscope to observe the relayed image (a two-lens system). Even under optimal conditions (when neurons express fluorescence indicators and the relay lens has been properly implanted), a volume change of the dental cement between the baseplate and its attachment to the skull upon cement curing can cause misalignment with an altered distance between the objective and relay lenses, resulting in the poor image quality. A baseplate is a plate that helps mount the miniscope onto the skull and fixes the working distance between the objective and relay lenses. Thus, changes in the volume of the dental cement around the baseplate alter the distance between the lenses. The present protocol aims to minimize the misalignment problem caused by volume changes in the dental cement. The protocol reduces the misalignment by building an initial foundation of dental cement during relay lens implantation. The convalescence time after implantation is sufficient for the foundation of dental cement to cure the baseplate completely, so the baseplate can be cemented on this scaffold using as little new cement as possible. In the present article, we describe strategies for baseplating in mice to enable imaging of neuronal activity with an objective lens anchored in the miniscope.",

    "abstractNote": "Fronto-striatal circuits have been extensively implicated in the cognitive control of behavioral output for both social and appetitive rewards. The functional diversity of prefrontal cortical populations is strongly dependent on their synaptic targets, with control of motor output strongly mediated by connectivity to the dorsal striatum. Despite evidence for functional diversity along the anterior-posterior axis of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), it is unclear how distinct fronto- striatal sub-circuits support neural computations essential for action selection. Here we identify prefrontal populations targeting distinct DMS subregions and characterize their functional roles. We first performed neural circuit tracing to reveal segregated prefrontal populations defined by anterior/posterior dorsomedial striatal target. We then probed the functional relevance of these parallel circuits via in vivo calcium imaging and temporally precise causal manipulations during a feedback-based 2-alternative choice task. Single-photon imaging revealed circuit-specific representations of task-relevant information with prelimbic neurons targeting anterior DMS (PL::A- DMS) uniquely encoded choices and responses to negative outcomes, while prelimbic neurons targeting posterior DMS (PL::P-DMS) encoded internal representations of value and positive outcomes contingent on prior choice. Consistent with this distributed coding, optogenetic inhibition of PL::A-DMS circuits strongly impacted choice monitoring and behavioral control in response to negative outcomes while perturbation of PL::P-DMS signals impaired task engagement and strategies following positive outcomes. Di-synaptic retrograde tracing uncovered differences in afferent connectivity that may underlie these pathways functional divergence. Together our data uncover novel PL populations engaged in distributed processing for action control.\nSUMMARYPrelimbic cortex engages A- and P-DMS via distinct circuitsPL::A-DMS and PL::P-DMS pathways encode divergent aspects of a simple goal-directed taskPL::A-DMS pathways shape responding to negative outcomes via multiple mechanismsPL::P-DMS pathways guide engagement and choices in response to positive outcomesAfferent connectomes of PL neurons defined by A-P DMS target are distinct",

    "abstractNote": "Escape from threats has paramount importance for survival. However, it is unknown if a single circuit controls escape vigor from innate and conditioned threats. Cholecystokinin (cck)-expressing cells in the hypothalamic dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd) are necessary for initiating escape from innate threats via a projection to the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG). We now show that in mice PMd-cck cells are activated during escape, but not other defensive behaviors. PMd-cck ensemble activity can also predict future escape. Furthermore, PMd inhibition decreases escape speed from both innate and conditioned threats. Inhibition of the PMd-cck projection to the dlPAG also decreased escape speed. Intriguingly, PMd-cck and dlPAG activity in mice showed higher mutual information during exposure to innate and conditioned threats. In parallel, human functional magnetic resonance imaging data show that a posterior hypothalamic-to-dlPAG pathway increased activity during exposure to aversive images, indicating that a similar pathway may possibly have a related role in humans. Our data identify the PMd-dlPAG circuit as a central node, controlling escape vigor elicited by both innate and conditioned threats.",

    "abstractNote": "Animals must balance needs to approach threats for risk assessment and to avoid danger. The dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) controls defensive behaviors, but it is unknown how it represents states associated with threat approach and avoidance. We identified a dPAG threatavoidance ensemble in mice that showed higher activity farther from threats such as the open arms of the elevated plus maze and a predator. These cells were also more active during threat avoidance behaviors such as escape and freezing, even though these behaviors have antagonistic motor output. Conversely, the threat approach ensemble was more active during risk assessment behaviors and near threats. Furthermore, unsupervised methods showed that avoidance/approach states were encoded with shared activity patterns across threats. Lastly, the relative number of cells in each ensemble predicted threat avoidance across mice. Thus, dPAG ensembles dynamically encode threat approach and avoidance states, providing a flexible mechanism to balance risk assessment and danger avoidance.",

    "abstractNote": "In vivo calcium imaging using head-mounted miniature microscopes enables tracking activity from neural populations over weeks in freely behaving animals. Previous studies focus on inferring behavior from a population of neurons, yet it is challenging to extract neuronal signals given out-of-focus fluorescence in endoscopic data. Existing analysis pipelines include regions of interest (ROIs) identification, which might lose relevant information from false negatives or introduce unintended bias from false positives. Moreover, these methods often require prior knowledge for parameter tuning and are time-consuming for implementation. Here, we develop an end-to-end decoder to predict the behavioral variables directly from the raw microendoscopic images. Our framework requires little user input and outperforms existing decoders that need ROI extraction. We show that neuropil/background residuals carry additional behaviorally relevant information. Video analysis further reveals an optimal decoding window and dynamics between residuals and cells. Critically, saliency maps reveal the emergence of video-decomposition across our decoder, and identify distinct clusters representing different behavioral aspects. Together, we present a framework that is efficient for decoding behavior from microendoscopic imaging, and may help discover functional clustering for a variety of imaging studies.",

    "abstractNote": "Studies of the neural basis of memory and decision making have utilized rats as a model organism for decades. Place cells in the hippocampus were first described fifty years ago, and our understanding of the cellular mechanisms of episodic memory and spatial navigation have been primarily based on the rat as a model organism. Modern calcium imaging techniques now allow researchers to monitor hundreds of cells simultaneously, and this has been a boon to brain research. However, until my first publication, calcium imaging in the freely behaving rat had not been demonstrated, and emerging research using calcium imaging in the mouse hippocampus conflicted with decades of rat literature. An intellectual gap was widening, and it was unclear whether differing results stemmed from differences in species or methodology. Therefore, we sought to apply calcium imaging to the rat to demonstrate its feasibility and utility. The research presented in this dissertation is a demonstration of both my efforts developing rat calcium imaging within the Miniscope open-science project, as well as applying these methods to specific hypotheses. Chapter 2 details our most recent experiment, studying the effect of aversive learning on hippocampal place cells and the role of cholinergic signaling. Chapter 3 summarizes collaborative work on the technical development and imaging capabilities of the Large Field of View miniature microscope utilized in the previous chapter. Chapter 4 presents my first co-authored publication where we demonstrated the first usage of single photon calcium imaging in the freely behaving rat, studying how cortical neurons reflect choice utility during effortful decision making.",

    "abstractNote": "It is believed that the brain creates representations of the world that are elaborated and refined through experience. Yet, it is unknown how such representations are created and altered by experience. The hippocampus has been demonstrated to be crucial for memory processes but relationships between the activity of hippocampal principal neurons and memory representations have been difficult to describe. In this thesis, we examine hippocampal activity using different neurophysiological and theoretical tools to address this question. Using local-field potential recording following pathway-specific stimulations, we demonstrate that spatial learning can cause long-lasting changes to hippocampal circuit function. These changes are limited to specific dendritic compartments which are important for normal cognition, are the support of a general improvement in cognition rather than specific to memories, and rely on changes to inhibitory circuits. Furthermore, we assessed how specific representations can be encoded in the activity of CA1 hippocampal neurons. Using calcium-imaging in freely behaving mice, we recorded large ensembles of neurons and demonstrated that coactivity dynamics are important for encoding distinct environments. These temporal dynamics rely disproportionately on anti-coactive cell pairs, display scale-free properties, and are naturally represented on a 2-D non-linear manifold. Preliminary results indicate that spatial memory learning also alters temporal dynamics. We conclude that experience-dependent alterations can be directly measured and that temporal coactivity constitutes an advantageous code for their description.",

    "abstractNote": "Hippocampal CA1 place cell spatial maps are known to alter their firing properties in response to contextual fear conditioning, a process called “remapping.” In the present study, we use chronic calcium imaging to examine remapping during fear retrieval and extinction of an inhibitory avoidance task in mice of both sexes over an extended period of time and with thousands of neurons. We demonstrate that hippocampal ensembles encode space at a finer scale following fear memory acquisition. This effect is strongest near the shock grid. We also characterize the long-term effects of shock on place cell ensemble stability, demonstrating that shock delivery induces several days of high fear and low between-session place field stability, followed by a new, stable spatial representation that appears after fear extinction. Finally, we identify a novel group of CA1 neurons that robustly encode freeze behavior independently from spatial location. Thus, following fear acquisition, hippocampal CA1 place cells sharpen their spatial tuning and dynamically change spatial encoding stability throughout fear learning and extinction.\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The hippocampus contains place cells that encode an animal's location. This spatial code updates, or remaps, in response to environmental change. It is known that contextual fear can induce such remapping; in the present study, we use chronic calcium imaging to examine inhibitory avoidance-induced remapping over an extended period of time and with thousands of neurons and demonstrate that hippocampal ensembles encode space at a finer scale following electric shock, an effect which is enhanced by threat proximity. We also identify a novel group of freeze behavior-activated neurons. These results suggest that, more than merely shuffling their spatial code following threat exposure, place cells enhance their spatial coding with the possible benefit of improved threat localization.",

    "abstractNote": "Observing the activity of large populations of neurons in vivo is critical for understanding brain function and dysfunction. The use of fluorescent genetically-encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) in conjunction with miniaturized microscopes is an exciting emerging toolset for recording neural activity in unrestrained animals. Despite their potential, current miniaturized microscope designs are limited by using image sensors with low frame rates, sensitivity, and resolution. Beyond GECIs, there are many neuroscience applications which would benefit from the use of other emerging neural indicators, such as fluorescent genetically-encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) that have faster temporal resolution to match neuron spiking, yet, require imaging at high speeds to properly sample the activity-dependent signals. We integrated an advanced CMOS image sensor into a popular open-source miniaturized microscope platform. MiniFAST is a fast and sensitive miniaturized microscope capable of 1080p video, 1.5 µm resolution, frame rates up to 500 Hz and high gain ability (up to 70 dB) to image in extremely low light conditions. We report results of high speed 500 Hz in vitro imaging of a GEVI and ∼300 Hz in vivo imaging of transgenic Thy1-GCaMP6f mice. Finally, we show the potential for a reduction in photobleaching by using high gain imaging with ultra-low excitation light power (0.05 mW) at 60 Hz frame rates while still resolving Ca2+ spiking activity. Our results extend miniaturized microscope capabilities in high-speed imaging, high sensitivity and increased resolution opening the door for the open-source community to use fast and dim neural indicators.",

    "abstractNote": "<p>Animal behavior is regulated by environmental stimuli and is shaped by the activity of neural networks, underscoring the importance of assessing the morpho-functional properties of different populations of cells in freely behaving animals. In recent years, a number of optical tools have been developed to monitor and modulate neuronal and glial activity at the protein, cellular, or network level and have opened up new avenues for studying brain function in freely behaving animals. Tools such as genetically encoded sensors and actuators are now commonly used for studying brain activity and function through their expression in different neuronal ensembles. In parallel, microscopy has also made major progress over the last decades. The advent of miniature microscopes (mini-microscopes also called mini-endoscopes) has become a method of choice for studying brain activity at the cellular and network levels in different brain regions of freely behaving mice. This technique also allows for longitudinal investigations while animals carrying the microscope on their head are performing behavioral tasks. In this review, we will discuss mini-endoscopic imaging and the advantages that these devices offer to research. We will also discuss current limitations of and potential future improvements in mini-endoscopic imaging.</p>",

    "abstractNote": "In vivo fluorescence miniature microscopy has recently proven a major advance, enabling cellular imaging in freely behaving animals. However, fluorescence imaging suffers from autofluorescence, phototoxicity, photobleaching and non- homogeneous illumination artifacts. These factors limit the quality and time course of data collection. Bioluminescence provides an alternative kind of activity-dependent light indicator. Bioluminescent calcium indicators do not require light input, instead generating photons through chemiluminescence. As such, limitations inherent to the requirement for light presentation are eliminated. Further, bioluminescent indicators also do not require excitation light optics: the removal of these components should make a lighter and lower cost microscope with fewer assembly parts. While there has been significant recent progress in making brighter and faster bioluminescence indicators, the advances in imaging hardware have not yet been realized. A hardware challenge is that despite potentially higher signal-to-noise of bioluminescence, the signal strength is lower than that of fluorescence. An open question we address in this report is whether fluorescent miniature microscopes can be rendered sensitive enough to detect bioluminescence. We demonstrate this possibility in vitro and in vivo by implementing optimizations of the UCLA fluorescent miniscope v3.2. These optimizations yielded a miniscope (BLmini) which is 22% lighter in weight, has 45% fewer components, is up to 58% less expensive, offers up to 15 times stronger signal and is sensitive enough to capture spatiotemporal dynamics of bioluminescence in the brain with a signal-to-noise ratio of 34 dB.",

    "abstractNote": "Survival in complex environments necessitates a flexible navigation system that incorporates memory of recent behavior and associations. Yet, how the hippocampal spatial circuit represents latent information independent of sensory inputs and future goals has not been determined. To address this, we image the activity of large ensembles in subregion CA1 via wide-field fluorescent microscopy during a novel behavioral paradigm. Our results demonstrate that latent information is represented through reliable firing rate changes during unconstrained navigation. We then hypothesize that the representation of latent information in CA1 is mediated by pattern separation/completion processes instantiated upstream within the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 subregions. Indeed, CA3 ensemble recordings reveal an analogous code for latent information. Moreover, selective chemogenetic inactivation of DG–CA3 circuitry completely and reversibly abolishes the CA1 representation of latent information. These results reveal a causal and specific role of DG–CA3 circuitry in the maintenance of latent information within the hippocampus.",

    "abstractNote": "Latent learning allows the brain the transform experiences into cognitive maps, a form of implicit memory, without reinforced training. Its mechanism is unclear. We tracked the internal states of the hippocampal neural ensembles and discovered that during latent learning of a spatial map, the state space evolved into a low-dimensional manifold that topologically resembled the physical environment. This process requires repeated experiences and sleep in-between. Further investigations revealed that a subset of hippocampal neurons, instead of rapidly forming place fields in a novel environment, remained weakly tuned but gradually developed correlated activity with other neurons. These ‘weakly spatial’ neurons bond activity of neurons with stronger spatial tuning, linking discrete place fields into a map that supports flexible navigation.",

    "abstractNote": "In virtual reality settings, spatial navigation in animal models has traditionally been studied using primarily visual cues. However, auditory cues play an important role in navigation for animals, especially when the visual system cannot detect objects or predators in the dark. We have developed a virtual reality system defined exclusively by auditory landmarks for head-fixed mice performing a navigation task. We report behavioral evidence that mice can learn to navigate in our task. Namely, we observed anticipatory licking and modest anticipatory slowing preceding the reward region. Furthermore, we found that the animal’s licking behavior changes when switching from a familiar virtual environment to a novel virtual environment, followed by reverting to normal licking behavior after the familiar virtual environment is re-introduced within the same session. While animals carried out the task, we performed in-vivo calcium imaging in the CA1 region of the hippocampus using a modified Miniscope system. We envision that this approach has the potential to provide new insight into how animals respond to stimuli using spatial aspects of sound in an environment.

    "abstractNote": "Simultaneous imaging and manipulation of a genetically defined neuronal population can provide a causal link between its activity and function. Here, we designed a miniaturized microscope (or ‘miniscope’) that allows fluorescence imaging and optogenetic manipulation at the cellular level in freely behaving animals. This miniscope has an integrated optical connector that accepts any combination of external light sources, allowing flexibility in the choice of sensors and manipulators. Moreover, due to its simple structure and use of open source software, the miniscope is easy to build and modify. Using this miniscope, we demonstrate the optogenetic silencing of hippocampal CA1 neurons using two laser light sources—one stimulating a calcium sensor (i.e., jGCaAMP7c) and the other serving as an optogenetic silencer (i.e., Jaws). This new miniscope can contribute to efforts to determine causal relationships between neuronal network dynamics and animal behavior.",

    "abstractNote": "Most adaptive behaviors require precise tracking of targets in space. In pursuit behavior with a moving target, mice use distance to target to guide their own movement continuously. Here, we show that in the sensorimotor striatum, parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) can represent the distance between self and target during pursuit behavior, while striatal projection neurons (SPNs), which receive FSI projections, can represent self-velocity. FSIs are shown to regulate velocity-related SPN activity during pursuit, so that movement velocity is continuously modulated by distance to target. Moreover, bidirectional manipulation of FSI activity can selectively disrupt performance by increasing or decreasing the self-target distance. Our results reveal a key role of the FSI-SPN interneuron circuit in pursuit behavior and elucidate how this circuit implements distance to velocity transformation required for the critical underlying computation.",

    "abstractNote": "<p>The ability to simultaneously image the spatiotemporal activity signatures from many neurons during unrestrained vertebrate behaviors has become possible through the development of miniaturized fluorescence microscopes, or miniscopes, sufficiently light to be carried by small animals such as bats, birds and rodents. Miniscopes have permitted the study of circuits underlying song vocalization, action sequencing, head-direction tuning, spatial memory encoding and sleep to name a few. The foundation for these microscopes has been laid over the last two decades through academic research with some of this work resulting in commercialization. More recently, open-source initiatives have led to an even broader adoption of miniscopes in the neuroscience community. Open-source designs allow for rapid modification and extension of their function, which has resulted in a new generation of miniscopes that now permit wire-free or wireless recording, concurrent electrophysiology and imaging, two-color fluorescence detection, simultaneous optical actuation and read-out as well as wide-field and volumetric light-field imaging. These novel miniscopes will further expand the toolset of those seeking affordable methods to probe neural circuit function during naturalistic behaviors. Here, we will discuss the early development, present use and future potential of miniscopes.</p>",

Head-mounted miniature microscopes are emerging as a key tool to address this challenge. Here we discuss recent work leading to the miniaturization of neural imaging tools, the current state of the art in this field, and the importance and necessity of open-source options. We finish with a discussion on what the future may hold for miniature microscopy.",
