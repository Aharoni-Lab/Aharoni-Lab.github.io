title: "Lab Compact and Philosophy"

We are currently working on a range of projects aimed at addressing and overcoming fundamental hurdles in modern neuroscience. This often involves open-source tool/technique development that is directly driven by specific, open questions in neuroscience. We then use these novel tools in lab and in collaboration with other groups to investigate neurological function within the context of complex behavior. **Our research is open-source, highly collaborative and multi-disciplinary by nature.**

## Some research projects and areas of interest are outlined below
### Long-term continuous neuro-behavioral recording and processing platforms for naturally behaving animals
